(When would you want to create a remote repository rather than using a local repository ?)

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?


    When I want to collaborate  and have others see my code !

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


    Not to have conflicts with my code.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?


    Fork = clone from one Github Account to another one.
    Clone = From GitHub to local computer
    Branch = A copy on local computer but a modified version of code


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can track differences b/w my code and remote code

and what would be harder?
