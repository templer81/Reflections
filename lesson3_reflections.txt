(When would you want to create a remote repository rather than using a local repository ?)

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In collaboration,with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Not to have conflicts with my code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   fork = copy of gitHub repo to your GitHub account 
   clone = copy of GitHub repo to a local repo
   branches = modification of main(master) branch (usually)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can track differences b/w my code and remote code
